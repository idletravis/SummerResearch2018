Research into Code Reuse Attacks

As of 7/14/18 this only runs on Linux machines. Johnathan Salwan's ROPGadget (https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget)
and Volatility Foundation's Volatility (https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) packages need to be installed prior to use.
The code will only target files saved within the CRA-Program directory or any subdirectories.
